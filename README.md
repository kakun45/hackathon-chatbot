# Mental Health Conversations in Extended Reality

Welcome to the Mental Health Conversations in Extended Reality project repository! This project aims to showcase the potential of Extended Reality (XR) environments in facilitating real-world conversations between mental health therapists and patients. By leveraging XR technology, we explore the before and after of such conversations, highlighting key improvements enabled by real-time access to specific information from MongoDB Vector search.

## Project Overview

In this project, we simulate conversations between a mental health therapist and a patient within an XR environment. The therapist utilizes documents and information sourced in real-time from MongoDB Vector search to enhance the effectiveness and relevance of the conversation. By visualizing these interactions in XR, we aim to demonstrate the transformative potential of technology in mental health care.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Access to Information**: Therapists can pull in specific information and documents from MongoDB Vector search to inform and enrich conversations with patients.
- **XR Environment**: The virtual world, including the therapist's office and surrounding environment, is generated using AI, providing an immersive backdrop for therapeutic sessions.
- **Anonymized Data Collection**: The long-term vision for this project involves collating anonymized data across different patients to identify trends and patterns in mental health issues, ultimately leading to improved treatment approaches.

## Future Development

As we continue to evolve this project, our focus will be on:
- Enhancing the realism and effectiveness of conversations through improved AI-generated environments and natural language processing capabilities.
- Expanding data collection efforts to include a broader range of patient interactions and demographics.
- Integrating additional features and functionalities to support mental health professionals in their practice.
